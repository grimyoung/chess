# chess

A simple chess game playable through the command line.

## Notes to future self
1. Need to check if stalemate end condition works properly
2. Make the display better so that diagonals are easier to see
3. Implement a save-load feature
4. Implement addtional draw conditions (perpetual check, 50 moves without pawn move or capture, etc.)
5. Refactor code to remove code ~~smell~~ stench
